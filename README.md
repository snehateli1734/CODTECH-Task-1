Objective:
Build basic programs using fundamental programming constructs like variables, conditional logic, looping, and functions. Work with user input to create fun and interactive programs.

Key activities:
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP enables developers to organize their code into reusable and independent modules or components, making it easier to manage complex applications.

Technology Used:
simple calculator using the Python Tkinter module, which can perform basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
